    State of Matter Project
  </p>

  <p class="paragraph">
    My project represents the state of matter liquid. It takes the shape of its container, the beaker, yet keeps a consistent volume. The particles in the liquid can move around other particles and bounce off the sides of the container. They cannot go outside the container without being acted on by an outside force that causes them to do so. The particles, the way the move, where they bounce, and where they are created in the canvas was created using Javascript. HTML is what the page is actually built on, and CSS was used to position and size the image and canvas correctly.
